## Issues

- add widgets to the dashboard (product, purchases and sales (all time and today and tables), lead products, today's revenue, all time revenue).
- add a billing route that handles managing customer's subscriptions
- add a verify route that handles verifying documents in the app.
- during the initial trial, the debut subscription should start at the trials end date and not immediately.
- handle one-time initial setup payment for their pharmacy and a recurring payment every subsequent month.
- add a branded loading indicator for the app. Showcasing the logo during app navigation.
- setup events/listeners/broadcasters on essential app metrics like stock count, user subscription and trial.
- handle transfers for the app. users should be able to collect payment from customers and get it into their bank accounts without
routing via JavaTechnovation's payment handler.
- verify customer's credential before incorporating the above. this includes bank account numbers and names. KYC.
- add filter to change the query from weeks to days to years. (metrics stats overview)
